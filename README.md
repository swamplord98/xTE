# xTE
xTE is a text editor writen in Java. It's a solo project that I (Swamplord98) am working on for fun. I don't use IDE's, I only use xed (xed can be found https://github.com/linuxmint/xed)

# v0.01
The first version on xTE. Nothing works other than you can type.

# v0.02
You can now Save and Open files.
